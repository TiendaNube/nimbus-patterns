# Nimbus Patterns - Build Process Documentation

## This document describes the current technical build process followed by Nimbus Patterns.

As of today, the current build process is based on the [Nimbus Design System Build Process](https://github.com/TiendaNube/nimbus-design-system/blob/master/docs/BUILD_PROCESS.md), with the only difference being that here we **only build packages** marked to **bump** with the Yarn versioning tool (make your changes and use `yarn bump:check --interactive`).

Feel free to check the Nimbus-DS Build Process doc to understand more about the process!
