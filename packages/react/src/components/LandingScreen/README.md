## Landing Screen - Design System Pattern

The Landing Screen is a structured layout that presents users with an opportunity to take action before accessing the main content. It combines key UI components such as call-to-action buttons, engaging images, and informative text to guide users toward a specific interaction. This pattern is ideal for onboarding flows, promotional messages, or consent requests, ensuring users engage with a required action before proceeding.
